Based on the attached screenshot make a simple infinite-scroll application using Dribbble API — http://developer.dribbble.com/v1/

# Things to know:
* We haven’t included a PSD file for a reason. We believe that pixel-perfect implementation can only be achieved by understanding the design process and not by reading specifications available in PSD files
* Great developers use great tools. Don’t be afraid to show what web-development tools you use (CSS pre-processors, Javascript task-runners, etc.)
* We won’t check for IE9 support, so we're saying a big YES to the usage of cutting-edge technologies available in modern browsers  (think Flexbox, CSS Grids, etc.)

# Requirements:
* Design should be recreated as closely as possible including hover state (look at the first picture)
* Responsive design (with at least three breakpoints — Desktop, Tablet, Phone)
* Infinite scroll
* A possibility to favourite a shot (Dribbble API is read-only, so fake it ’til you make it)
* Only jQuery-like libraries allowed (no jQuery plugins, though)
* The code should be well-formatted and semantically valid. Use one of the following guides: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript and http://mdo.github.io/code-guide/

# Bonus points for:
* Lazy-loading images
* A responsive image solution (Save traffic by loading 2x images only when it’s needed)
* Using only Vanilla JS
* Using best JavaScript Design practices
